# roma-exceldata

**roma-exceldata** is an Excel configuration file example for the game service [roma](https://github.com/go-pantheon/roma), used to demonstrate game data configuration methods.

## Overview

This repository serves as a reference implementation for managing game configurations using Excel files in the Roma framework. It demonstrates best practices for structuring game data and showcases the powerful features of Roma's configuration system.

## Features

- Supports 2D tables and K-V tables
- Supports multiple data formats, such as int, float, string, bool, array, map, etc.
- Supports data table relationships, including one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many
- Supports data table inheritance
- Supports various merging methods for specified fields
- Supports configuration data validation rules
- Supports custom field generation types

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/go-pantheon/roma-exceldata.git
cd roma-exceldata
```

## Usage

### Data Generation
Uses [vulcan](https://github.com/go-pantheon/roma/tree/main/vulcan/app/gamedata/) in [roma](https://github.com/go-pantheon/roma) project to convert Excel files to JSON files and generate Go code:

```bash
# must in root directory of roma project
make tools

# generate json and go code
make gen-all-data

# only generate json (option) 
make gen-data-json

# only generate go code (option) 
make gen-data-base && make gen-datas
```

### Example Configuration

The `examples` directory contains sample Excel files demonstrating various configuration patterns:

- `Hero/Hero.xlsx`: the configuration of collectable heroes in the game
- `Property/Attribute.xlsx`: the configuration of attributes and calculation formulas in the game
- `Recharge/Recharge.xlsx`: the configuration of platforms and recharge in the game
- `Resource/Resource.xlsx`: the configuration of items and gift packs in the game
